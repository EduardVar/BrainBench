test plan: TO FILL OUT

How did your team organize the documentations of the test cases (e.g. where did you store the test case markdown file for each team member).
Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub.
How are you going to organize different test case code files? (a folder for a specification?)
