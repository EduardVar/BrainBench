| test_bad_login | Testing to see if the "login failed" message appeared as the #login_msg element after a failed login attempt. | Very first test made so it didn't have access to the id of the header that would assert "login failed" on screen. | `self.assert_element("")` [It wasn't able to assert the element was there] | Added an id in the webpage under login.html checking `<h4 id="login_msg">{{message}}</h4>` | 
| test_bad_password2 | Checking that the complexity message "PUT IT HERE" appeared under #login_msg when the given password was more than 6 characters | Kept writing "Password length must be greator than 6." in #login_msg even though the password had more than 6 characters in it! | Under `backend.py` when deciding what the error message should be, it does the logic with two `if` statements under line `29` and `32`, therefore the line `32` message would always be the message since it's set after. | Changed line `32` conditional to an `elif` so it sends the desired "less than 6 characters" message when it's actually less than 6 characters. |
