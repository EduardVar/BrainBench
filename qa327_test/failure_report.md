| test_bad_login | Testing to see if the "login failed" message appeared as the #login_msg element after a failed login attempt. | Very first test made so it didn't have access to the id of the header that would assert "login failed" on screen. | `self.assert_element("")` [It wasn't able to assert the element was there] | Added an id in the webpage under login.html checking `<h4 id="login_msg">{{message}}</h4>` | 
| test_bad_password2 | Checking that the complexity message "PUT IT HERE" appeared under #login_msg when the given password was more than 6 characters | Kept writing "Password length must be greator than 6." in #login_msg even though the password had more than 6 characters in it! | Under `backend.py` when deciding what the error message should be, it does the logic with two `if` statements under line `29` and `32`, therefore the line `32` message would always be the message since it's set after. | Changed line `32` conditional to an `elif` so it sends the desired "less than 6 characters" message when it's actually less than 6 characters. |
| login_loginFailed() 1.9.1           | redirecting to /login and show message 'email/password combination incorrect.                           | Did not show message 'email/password combination incorrect' | return None in backend.py function: def login_user(email, password):                  | Change return None to return "Email/password combination incorrect." |
| login_loginCheck() 1.1              | If the user hasn't logged in, show the login page + current page has a message that says 'please login' | Did not show message 'Please log in'                        | html element did not have an id html message did not have 'Please log in'             | Gave html element id: "login-prompt" Changed html message            |
| login_emailFormattingErrors() 1.9.1 | For any formatting errors, render the login page and show the message 'email format is incorrect.'      | Did not show message 'Email format is incorrect'            | html element did not have an id html message did not have 'Email format is incorrect' | Gave html element id: "#login_msg" Changed html message              |
| testPageHeader                      | Checking if the header on the homepage displayed the user's name correctly                              | Checked for the wrong case sensitivity in the header        | html element would check for if the header displayed "Test_frontend" instead of "test_frontend | Changed the test case to check for the correct case sensitivity |
