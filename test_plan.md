## The order of the test cases (which level first which level second)
The prirotiy order for test cases will be:
1) Front End
2) Backend
3) Integration

## Techniques and tools used for testing
* Techniques: automated test with qa327_test
* Tools for testing: Github Actions CLI, pytest

## Test environments (all the local environment and the cloud environment) for the testing
* Local environment:Developer Machines
* Cloud environment: Github actions, Github servers

## Responsibility (who is responsible for which test case, and in case of failure, who should you contact)
* In case of failure, contact whoever who “commit”ed the crime

## Budget Management  (how to monitor, keep track and minimize unnecessary cost)
* Repo owner (Kirynn) can check the remaining minutes. Moving forward, will have repo owner check the CI after every big update to a branch (makes sure we’re not overdoing it)
* Minimize unnecessary cost: Run tests locally
